## Project Overview

This project is a basic recipe website. It contains a homepage (`index.html`) that links to three separate recipe pages for:

- Lasagna
- Banana Bread
- Turtle Cheesecake

The recipes were adapted from AllRecipes.com and styled using simple HTML to improve my understanding of basic web development.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML**: Used to structure the content of the web pages.

No other technologies (CSS, JavaScript, etc.) were used, as the focus was purely on learning and applying HTML.

## Features

- Homepage that links to individual recipe pages.
- Recipe pages with details on ingredients and instructions.
- Simple and clean HTML structure.

## Structure

Here’s the structure of the project:
    ```bash

    ├── index.html 
    └── recipes 
            ├── lasagna.html 
            ├── banana-bread.html 
            └── turtle-cheesecake.html

- **index.html**: The main landing page with links to the recipe pages.
- **recipes/**: A directory that contains the HTML files for each recipe.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/odin-recipes.git
2. Open the `index.html` file in your browser to explore the recipes.

## Future Improvements

I plan to improve the user interface as I start learning CSS. Future enhancements will potentially include:

- Adding styling using CSS for better visual presentation.
- Enhancing layout and navigation for a more user-friendly experience.
