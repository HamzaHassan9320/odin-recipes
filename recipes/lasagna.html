        Can You Freeze Chicken Lasagna?
        If you're planning to freeze the white chicken lasagna, 
        it's best to cook it in a foil baking dish. 
        Allow it to cool, then cover the whole thing in at 
        least one layer of storage wrap. Wrap it again in aluminum 
        foil to prevent freezer burn. Freeze for up to three months.
